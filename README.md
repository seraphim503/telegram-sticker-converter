# ðŸ“Œ Notes

Maximum Telegram sticker length is 3 seconds â€” the script will speed up longer clips.

Output format is VP9 .webm, ready for upload to Telegram.

File size over 256 KB will still work in Telegram, but may fail for animated sticker packs.

# ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

"ffmpeg is not recognized" â†’ Install FFmpeg and add it to your systemâ€™s PATH.

Wrong folder paths â†’ Make sure SRC_DIR points to your working directory.
